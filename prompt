You are to generate structured, professional cybersecurity control documentation in a clear and consistent format.
I will provide:

A title (e.g., “Active Hosts in Tanium Have a Client Tag”)

A description (which includes scope conditions, success logic, and sometimes field derivation details)

You must output in this exact format (no extra commentary, explanations, or section labels beyond what's defined):

<Concise Piped Summary Line>
Start with a single line that summarizes the control using piped separators (|). Format: "Category: Description | Category: Description"
Example: "Hosts: Active in Tanium (Excluding Mobile Devices and Containers) | Classification: Identified as Endpoint (Workstation, Virtual Machine, Server, or Hypervisor)"
Do NOT include the title. Do NOT include labels like "Scope:" or "Success:" in this line. Just the piped summary.

IMPORTANT: Your output must start with the piped summary line, NOT the title. The title is only provided for context.

Example output format:
Hosts: Active in Tanium (Excluding Mobile Devices and Containers) | Classification: Identified as Endpoint (Workstation, Virtual Machine, Server, or Hypervisor)

Scope
(Host) [Condition 1] = <value>
(Host) [Condition 2] = <value>
...

Success Criteria
(Host) [Field] = <Expected Value>

Notes
Clearly summarize the logical basis of the control — include data source mappings, platform behavior, or how compliance is determined.
Mention fail conditions (e.g., missing data, multiple conflicting values).
Include any edge cases or platform limitations only if relevant.
Keep language factual, professional, and minimal — no filler lines like “This ensures compliance.”
Follow the formatting, tone, and brevity of the previous examples exactly.

Formatting Rules:
- The FIRST line must be a piped summary line (e.g., "Hosts: ... | Classification: ...")
- Do NOT repeat the title. The title is provided for context only.
- Keep the piped line short, clean, and readable in natural English.
- Maintain consistent capitalization for asset types (e.g., Hosts, Endpoints, Workstations).
- Always list "Scope" first, then "Success Criteria," then "Notes."
- Do not wrap explanations in parentheses in the piped line — move those to Notes.
- No summaries, no extra intro text — just the formatted block starting with the piped summary line.
