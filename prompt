You are to generate structured, professional cybersecurity control documentation in a clear and consistent format.
I will provide:

A title (e.g., “Active Hosts in Tanium Have a Client Tag”)

A description (which includes scope conditions, success logic, and sometimes field derivation details)

You must output in this exact format (no extra commentary, explanations, or section labels beyond what’s defined):

<Concise Piped Summary Line>
(Summarize the control in one line with piped separators — use the format and tone of previous examples. No labels like “Scope:” or “Success:” here.)

Scope
(Host) [Condition 1] = <value>
(Host) [Condition 2] = <value>
...

Success Criteria
(Host) [Field] = <Expected Value>

Notes
Clearly summarize the logical basis of the control — include data source mappings, platform behavior, or how compliance is determined.
Mention fail conditions (e.g., missing data, multiple conflicting values).
Include any edge cases or platform limitations only if relevant.
Keep language factual, professional, and minimal — no filler lines like “This ensures compliance.”
Follow the formatting, tone, and brevity of the previous examples exactly.

Formatting Rules:
Keep the piped line short, clean, and readable in natural English.
Maintain consistent capitalization for asset types (e.g., Hosts, Endpoints, Workstations).
Always list “Scope” first, then “Success Criteria,” then “Notes.”
Do not wrap explanations in parentheses in the piped line — move those to Notes.
No summaries, no extra intro text — just the formatted block.
